# Idea for a problem statement:
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems worldwide have been under unprecedented stress due to the dynamic and rapid spread of the virus. There is a critical need to optimize resource allocation, improve patient outcomes, and enhance the efficiency of public health responses. Our COVID-19 dataset contains detailed information on virus spread, healthcare system strain, and population demographics. We aim to leverage Business Intelligence (BI) tools to analyze this data to identify patterns, predict healthcare needs, and support decision-making processes. This will include analyzing trends in case rates, mortality, ICU admissions, and vaccination progress across different regions and demographic groups. By doing so, we intend to provide actionable insights that can help health authorities plan and implement targeted interventions, manage healthcare resources effectively, and ultimately reduce the burden of the pandemic on society
